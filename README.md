*Overview*

The objective of this analysis was to make comparison between the different city types in terms of the amount of Fare earned in each type.

*Results*

As shown in the chart, the total fare earned in Urban city type is twice as high as the amount earned in Suburban cities, and 10 times higher than the total fare earned in Rural cities.  However, the average per ride is $10 higher in Rural cities than in Urban cities.  In addition to that, average Fare per driver is also $40 more in Rural cities, in comparison to Urban cities, due to the fact that rates in Rural areas are the highest and rates in Urban areas are the lowest.

*Implications*

Even though, the overall possibility of finding a ride in Urban city is far greater in comparison to Rural city, the drivers in Rural cities are earning much more than drivers in Urban cities. Even the average fare per driver in Suburban cities is more than twice the fare earned by drivers in Urban cities. The drivers in Urban cities are earning the lowest amount of money. 

*Recommendations*

The number of rides/customers in Suburban cities are 2.5 times less than Urban cities.  However, the number of drivers present in Suburban cities are 5 times less than Urban cities.  There is a presence of demand in the Suburban cities.  If we slightly decrease the rates in Suburban cities, we can expect the usage of the app to increase drastically which in turn could increase the average fare per driver in Suburban cities and entice many drivers in Urban cities to shift their focus on Suburban cities instead.  
Also, it seems like the customers in Rural cities are over-paying for the service.  Since there is very limited access to public transport in Rural cities, we should reduce the rates in Rural cities.
